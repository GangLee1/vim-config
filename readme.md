## Here is my vim config

It's still freshly made, but I'm pretty happy with where it is..

Should be stated, I'm runnning vim via terminal, not a gui.

Should also probably be stated, that I'm running solarized in terminal too. Noticed that even though the soloraized color mode for terminal worked fine I still had to manually set the colors 0-15 to what soloraized has set. Only then could I get my vim solarized color mode working properly.

See .gitmodules for submodules I'm using for [vim plugins](https://github.com/matthewsimo/vim-config/tree/master/.vim/bundle).

### My vim looks like:

### Notes:

- I've add tern, it requires a npm install after the submodule is cloned, heads up.
