## Here is my vim config

It's still freshly made, but I'm pretty happy with where it is..

Should be stated, I'm runnning vim via terminal, not a gui.

Should also probably be stated, that I'm running solarized in terminal too. Noticed that even though the soloraized color mode for terminal worked fine I still had to manually set the colors 0-15 to what soloraized has set. Only then could I get my vim solarized color mode working properly.


If I feel like it, I might clean up the formatting of .vimrc, also stands for this readme's contents... In the mean time here's a cute kitty..
